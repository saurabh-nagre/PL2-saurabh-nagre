            This is an android application focusion on managing the schedule of classes,
            meetings and more. I motivated to build this application for helping people to stay
            focused and also to stay connected with your collegues. This application has a chatting 
            feature which enable us to stay connected with people. As this firstly will be deployed for 
            managing the time table of our college, i hope it will soon be deployed on google play store.
            In this application i have used the firebase as the backend and java as a coding language.
            <br>
            Also this will be an open source and you can acccess it from below link:)
